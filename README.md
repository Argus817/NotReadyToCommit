# NotReadyToCommit

Damn, looks like you have reached this step. Now only you can help me find my key and solve this mystery. 

I encrypted an image using my SUPER SECRET KEY, but while uploading the files to GitHub, I accidently deleted the KEY. I can't seem to find it anywhere. The image had the location to the final piece of the puzzle. Without the KEY, I'm completely lost.

But with your help, expertise and commitment, I'm sure to find a way out of this mess. Find the KEY, it may be hidden somewhere, decrypt the image and the next clue is all yours

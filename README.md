Damn, looks like you have reached this step. Now only you can help me find my key and solve this mystery. 

I encrypted an image using my SUPER SECRET KEY, but while uploading the files to GitHub, I accidently deleted the KEY. I can't seem to find it anywhere. The image had the location to the final piece of the puzzle. Without the KEY, I'm completely lost.
